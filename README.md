# Data Structures & Algortihms
## Udacity Nanodegree Program Exercises

Overview
Here's a brief overview of what we'll cover in the program.

1. Welcome
In this section, we'll go over some important foundational topics. We'll review some basic Python concepts that you'll need, talk about how to solve problems, and then consider some of the fundamental ideas related to efficiency.

2. Data Structures
When you write code to solve a problem, there will always be data involved—and how you store or structure that data in the computer's memory can have a huge impact on what kinds of things you can do with it and how efficiently you can do those things. In this section, we'll explore different data structures, and consider the pros and cons of using different structures when solving different types of problems.

3. Basic Algorithms
To solve such problems, we need to come up with a very specific sequence of steps that will get us from whatever input we start with to the desired output. This kind of clear, highly specific procedure is called an algorithm. In this section, we'll get started with some elementary algorithms, such as binary search and mergesort.

4. Advanced Algorithms
In this final part of the program, we'll dive into some more advanced topics—including greedy algorithms, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and linear programming.
