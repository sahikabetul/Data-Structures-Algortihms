**The Goal:** Find the square root of the integer without using any Python library. You have to find the floor value of the square root.

- **Design:** I choose search square-root by binary tree for reduced efficiency. If I search by array, time complexity would be O(n)
- **Time Complexity:** O(logn) We search on only seperate part of groups.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) Just for one item.
