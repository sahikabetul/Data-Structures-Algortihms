**The Goal:** In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code should run in O(n) time. Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.
- **Design:** I kept min and max values in two variables. I started that variables with first item in list. I looked all item with for loop, and if necessary, changed the values of min, max variables.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) Iterated on all values of list
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) Used constant space.
