    "\n",
    "The purpose of an HTTP Router is to take a URL path like \"/\", \"/about\", or \"/blog/2019-01-15/my-awesome-blog-post\" and figure out what content to return. In a dynamic web server, the content will often come from a block of code called a handler.\n",

    "First we need to implement a slightly different Trie than the one we used for autocomplete. Instead of simple words the Trie will contain a part of the http path at each node, building from the root node /\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to a path though, we need to know which function will handle the http request. In a real router we would probably pass an instance of a class like Python's SimpleHTTPRequestHandler which would be responsible for handling requests to that path. For the sake of simplicity we will just use a string that we can print out to ensure we got the right handler\n",
